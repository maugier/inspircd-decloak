=====================
inspircd-decloak v0.1
=====================

This is a decloaker for the "full" cloaking algorithm of Inspircd 2.0 and above.
It is intended for server admins to decloak an IP a posteriori, if the clear whois
information is no longer available.

Cloaks computed with this algorithm look like "xxx.yyy.zzzzzz", with x,y and z being
digits or letters between a and v. The administrator can add a custom prefix (default
empty) or suffix (default ".IP").

To use the program you must know the network-wide secret cloaking key, defined as

    <cloak key="mysecretkey">

in the modules.conf file.


Usage:

    make
    ./cloak mysecretkey 127.0.0.1
    rpp.ger.bod9q3
    ./decloak mysecretkey rpp.ger.bod9q3
    127.0.0.1
